# Server-Client Chat System
A simple android Server-Client chat system where multiple clients can chat with the server using java socket programming. There are separate GUIs for server and client. The server can send its message to both individuals or multiple clients simultaneously, and the client can send its message to the server. Here, the two debugged .apk files (Server and Client). These files are unsigned .apk files. These are not protected by google playwright.

* **A spinner to see the connected clients list.**

# Extra features
